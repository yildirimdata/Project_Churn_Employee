# Project_Churn_Employee
A model built to predict whether an employee is churned or not

Employee churn, also known as employee turnover, refers to the rate at which employees leave a company and need to be replaced by new hires. It is a significant metric in human resources management and business operations, and it also holds relevance in the field of data science.

By using various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, this project aims to build a model to predict the risk of leaving the copany for an employee. The model will be deployed via Streamlit in the end.

After a detailed EDA process and statistical significance tests, the algorithms used to build and choose the model with the highest performeance are:

1) Unsupervised ML algorithm:

    - K-Prototype (since the data is a mix of categorical and numerical features)

2) Supervised ML algorithms:

     - Logistic Regression
     - KNN (K Nearest Neighbours)
     - Support Vector MAchine
     - Random Forest
     - Catboost
     - XGBoost
     - LightGBM

3) Deep Learning ANN

4) In the final step, we will deploy the model using Streamlit tool.
